## ❡ About

Libtmk (aka "Terminal Manipulation Kit") is a simple C99 terminal manipulation library that contains a modest set of features to manipulate terminal properties, styles, arguments and event readings primarily using UTF-8 encoding. It is available for Windows, macOS and Linux.

With its minimalistic and opinionated design, it encourages the development of software with great system compatibility, while leaving room to full-feature libraries to be built upon for more specific use cases.
